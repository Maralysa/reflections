How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


    It allowed me to easily pick out the differences between the files.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


    You can monitor the changes and easily revert back if something goes wrong.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


    Manually choosing allows you to pick logical times to commit things, rather than random or periodical times,
    but this can be problematic if you forget to save when you planned to.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


    Because he files depend upon each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


    git log shows all commits that hav been made and git diff shows the differences between two commits



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?


    If i mess something up it is easy to go back to find it and fix it



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


    large projects and collab projects
